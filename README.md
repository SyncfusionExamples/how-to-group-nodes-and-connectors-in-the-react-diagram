# How to Group Nodes and Connectors in the React Diagram
A quick-start React app that shows how to group nodes and connectors in the Syncfusion&reg; React Diagram component. Learn how to group nodes and connectors, programmatically and dynamically. Also learn how to update a node group and add annotations. Finally, it shows how to create a nested group.  

The React Diagram is a feature-rich component for visualizing, creating, and editing interactive diagrams. It supports creating flowcharts, organizational charts, mind maps, and BPMN charts through code or a visual interface. Grouping is used to cluster multiple nodes and connectors into a single element. A group acts like a container for its children.
